# Pomodoro
Pomodoro is a MERN-stack based website that helps the user manage their time effciently by allowing the user to create a custom timer with different work and break periods. The user can create a timer based on recommended Pomodoro timer settings that would work best for students and many more. Additionally, the user can add weblinks to block/grant access to certain websites during their break period. If the user tries to access any of the blocked websites during their work period, the weblink tab will get closed out immediately.
